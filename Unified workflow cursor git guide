Claude × Cursor × GitHub – Integrated Workflow Guide

Version: 1.0
Owner: Felix Isidorsson
Scope: Reproducible setup for code-first ideation, reliable context in chats, and durable documentation.

0) Why this setup works

One source of truth (GitHub). All context (code, data, docs, session notes) lives in the repo. Every tool reads from here.

Clear roles per tool.

Cursor → coding, tests, quick refactors, and automatic delta commits.

Claude Projects (desktop/web) → reasoning & design iteration with guaranteed repo context.

Claude Code (claude.ai/code) → deep repo browsing & scripted tasks when you need the agent inside the filesystem sandbox.

Local CLI (PowerShell + bash) → repeatable sync/append tasks (claude-export, claude-sync) into your docs.

Stateless chats, stateful repo. If a chat hits limits, you start a new one and summarise → saved as Markdown → appended to the master doc by claude-export. Nothing is trapped in a conversation.

1) Required repo structure (works for any component)

Use these top-level folders (capitalisation and spaces matter; prefer PascalCase for components and underscores for multi-word folders):

/Claude_Prompts/
  start-of-chat.md
  end-of-chat.md
  claude-local-setup.md           (optional helper notes)

 /notes/
  /claude-sessions/
    /<ComponentName>/
      <ComponentName>_MASTER.md   (canonical doc)
      <ComponentName>_YY_MMDD.md  (per-session summaries)

 /Data/
  /swipe_diagnostics/             (CSV or data inputs)

 /src/
  /Components/
    /<ComponentName>/
      <live>.tsx                  (current live implementation)
      API_Reference.md
      <ComponentName>.test.ts
      /Utils/
        *.ts
        Utils_Documentation.md

 /cursor/
  /rules/
    project-context.md

 .gitignore
 LICENSE
 README.md
 PROJECT_NOTES.md
 auto_commit.sh                   (Cursor auto-delta script)
 post_chat.sh                     (session → MASTER append)
 package.json / tsconfig / vitest files (as applicable)


Naming convention

Live component = the .tsx file directly inside /src/Components/<ComponentName>/.

Older versions, if kept, go in a Versions/ subfolder.

Session files: Carousel_07_021125.md style is fine; keep a single _MASTER.md.

2) GitHub, Cursor and Claude – linkage
2.1 GitHub ↔ Cursor

Open repo folder in Cursor.

Initialise Git if needed: git init → add remote → git push -u origin main.

Sign into GitHub in Cursor (Command Palette → “Sign in to GitHub”).

Confirm the VCS panel tracks changes.

2.2 GitHub ↔ Claude Projects (desktop/web)

In Claude, create a Project.

In Files, add your GitHub repo (content card shows as owner/repo • main).

In Project → Instructions, paste the startup routine (section 4 below).

Turn Memory OFF for this project (we rely on the repo, not memory).

2.3 GitHub ↔ Claude Code

Open claude.ai/code, attach the same repo.

This environment mounts the repo to /mnt/project/ and can list/browse it.

3) Cursor auto-delta commits (keeps a local “paper trail”)

We save succinct “deltas” when you’re actively editing, without spamming history.

auto_commit.sh (repo root):

#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Commit any code changes once per minute if there are diffs.

while true; do
  # Only code & docs; adjust globs as needed
  if git status --porcelain -- \
      "src/**" "notes/**" "Claude_Prompts/**" "Data/**" \
      "*.md" "*.ts" "*.tsx" | grep -q .; then
    TS=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M")
    git add -A
    git commit -m "delta: changes detected @ ${TS}"
    git push
  fi
  sleep 60
done


Run it (Cursor terminal):

chmod +x auto_commit.sh
./auto_commit.sh


Tip: keep this running only while you’re actively iterating. It commits only if there are changes.

4) Claude Project startup instructions (the reliable loader)

Paste this into Project → Instructions:

Whenever a new chat starts in this project, do this before answering:

1) Search & load repo knowledge (CRITICAL)
   - Session docs:
     Search: claude-sessions <ComponentName>_MASTER <ComponentName>_ session notes
     Load ALL files under /notes/claude-sessions/ and subfolders
   - Data:
     Search: swipe_diagnostics data csv flick glide velocity distance
     Load ALL files under /Data/ and subfolders
   - Live component code:
     Search: src components tsx <ComponentName> implementation
     Treat the .tsx directly in /src/Components/<ComponentName>/ as the LIVE version
   - Utilities & docs:
     Search: Utils API_Reference documentation gestureDetection animationConfig
     Load Utils/*.ts, API_Reference.md, tests
   - Project meta:
     Search: project-context PROJECT_NOTES
     Load /cursor/rules/project-context.md and PROJECT_NOTES.md

2) Apply context
   - Treat <ComponentName>_MASTER.md as canonical documentation
   - Treat live .tsx as current implementation
   - Treat CSVs as quantitative evidence
   - Treat session notes as chronological history

3) Respond
   - Only after the above are loaded, answer the first user message.


For multiple components, either keep a single Project and mention all component names in the searches, or create one Project per component for cleaner isolation.
Each new component = new chat thread (clear naming).

5) Start-/End-of-chat prompts (Claude_Prompts)

Keep plain, app-safe prompts (no file writes).

Claude_Prompts/start-of-chat.md

“You are my reasoning companion…”

“Load repo context per Project Instructions (session docs, data, live code, utils, meta)…”

“Acknowledge live .tsx location and MASTER doc…”

“Keep answers modular, concise, and export-friendly…”

Claude_Prompts/end-of-chat.md

“Generate a Session Summary with headings + bullets (decisions, changes, rationale).”

“Name it: <ComponentName>_<YY_MMDD>.md.”

“I will manually save this into /notes/claude-sessions/<ComponentName>/.”

“Do not attempt to write files; just output Markdown.”

Then you copy/paste the summary into the right folder and commit.

6) Local CLI helpers (PowerShell + bash)
6.1 post_chat.sh – append latest session to MASTER

(already working in your repo; generic version below)

#!/usr/bin/env bash
COMPONENT="${1:-Carousel}" # allow passing a component, defaults to Carousel
BASE="notes/claude-sessions/${COMPONENT}"
MASTER_FILE="${BASE}/${COMPONENT}_MASTER.md"

LATEST_SESSION=$(ls -t "${BASE}/${COMPONENT}"_*.md 2>/dev/null | grep -v "MASTER" | head -n 1)
[ -z "$LATEST_SESSION" ] && { echo "No session files in ${BASE}"; exit 1; }

DATE_TAG=$(basename "$LATEST_SESSION" | grep -oE '[0-9]{2}_[0-9]{6}')
TEMP_SNIPPET="${BASE}/Session_Integration_${DATE_TAG}.md"

cat <<EOF > "$TEMP_SNIPPET"
## $(basename "$LATEST_SESSION") — ${DATE_TAG//_//}

**Summary:** extracted from \`$(basename "$LATEST_SESSION")\`.
(Insert concise “what changed” bullets here if needed.)
---
EOF

awk -v s="$TEMP_SNIPPET" '
  BEGIN {ins=0}
  { if(!ins && /\*\*END OF MASTER DOCUMENTATION\*\*/) {
      while((getline l < s) > 0) print l; ins=1
    }
    print
  }' "$MASTER_FILE" > "${MASTER_FILE}.tmp" && mv "${MASTER_FILE}.tmp" "$MASTER_FILE"

git add "$MASTER_FILE" "$TEMP_SNIPPET"
git commit -m "Append ${COMPONENT} session: $(basename "$LATEST_SESSION")"
git push
echo "Done: appended into ${MASTER_FILE}"


Run:

bash ./post_chat.sh Carousel

6.2 PowerShell aliases (so you can type short commands)

Open your profile:

notepad $PROFILE


Add:

# allow 'bash' inside PowerShell (Git for Windows path)
Set-Alias bash "C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe"

# export = run the append script for the active component (default: Carousel)
function claude-export { param($component="Carousel"); bash "./post_chat.sh" $component }

# quick commit/push of notes
function claude-sync { git add .; git commit -m "Sync Claude session notes"; git push }


Restart PowerShell. Now you can run:

claude-export        # appends latest session → MASTER for Carousel
claude-export Carousel
claude-sync

7) Day-to-day workflow (optimized)

Create a dedicated chat per component in your Claude Project.
Name them like: Carousel – v1.1 ideation, Carousel – diagnostics, etc.

Ideate/iterate in Claude (Project) while coding in Cursor.

Cursor’s auto_commit.sh runs while you edit to capture deltas every minute.

When a chat nears limits, simply ask:
“Generate the Session Summary per our end-of-chat prompt.”
Copy the Markdown → save as /notes/claude-sessions/<Component>/<Component>_<YY_MMDD>.md → commit.

Run claude-export to append a small “integration log” block into <Component>_MASTER.md.
(We append; we never regenerate the master automatically.)

New component?

Create /src/Components/<NewComponent>/ with a live .tsx.

Create /notes/claude-sessions/<NewComponent>/<NewComponent>_MASTER.md.

Start a new chat thread for it (clean context), keep Memory OFF.

8) Files we include by default (and why)

.gitignore – ignore node_modules, build outputs, logs, temp, OS files. Example:

node_modules/
dist/
.DS_Store
*.log
.env
.cache/


LICENSE – pick MIT (or your choice) so code/doc reuse is clear.

README.md – project overview + “How to run”, link to this guide.

PROJECT_NOTES.md – higher-level design notes not tied to one component.

cursor/rules/project-context.md – what Cursor should “know” (brand tone, design goals, constraints).

Claude_Prompts/start-of-chat.md & end-of-chat.md – app-safe prompts Claude reads at session start/end.

auto_commit.sh – minute-based delta saver while you’re editing.

post_chat.sh – safe, append-only master integrator.

Tests/Configs – vitest, tsconfig, etc., as your stack requires.

9) Common pitfalls & fixes

Claude “can’t find files”

Ensure the GitHub content card is attached to the Project.

Paths in Project Instructions must match your repo (Claude_Prompts, not Claude Prompts).

Capitalisation matters: Data/ ≠ data/.

Desktop/web chat says /mnt/project/INSTRUCTIONS only

That means the Project has no repo mounted to it. Add the GitHub card to the Project’s Files.

MASTER doc overwritten

Our workflow is append-only. We never regenerate MASTER automatically. Keep it that way.

Auto-commit is too chatty

Stop the script while idle. Or add glob filters to restrict what it watches.

Hit Claude message limits

End the chat with the Session Summary, save it, start a new chat in the same Project.

10) Minimal “Start-of-chat” & “End-of-chat” (copy into /Claude_Prompts/)

start-of-chat.md

You are my reasoning companion for this project. Before replying:

• Load repo context per Project Instructions:
  – Session docs under /notes/claude-sessions/
  – Data in /Data/swipe_diagnostics/
  – Live .tsx under /src/Components/<ComponentName>/
  – Utils and API_Reference.md
  – Project meta in /cursor/rules/project-context.md and PROJECT_NOTES.md

• Treat <ComponentName>_MASTER.md as canonical.
• Keep answers modular, concise, export-ready.


end-of-chat.md

Output a single Markdown document:

# <ComponentName> – Session <YY-MMDD>
## Summary
• Key decisions
• What changed (code & rationale)
• Open questions / next steps

## References
• Files touched (paths)
• Data cited (CSV rows/columns if relevant)

(I will save this into /notes/claude-sessions/<ComponentName>/ and run `claude-export`.)

11) When to use which Claude surface

Claude Projects (desktop/web) – your default place for ideation & design discussion with guaranteed repo context (thanks to Project Instructions).

Claude Code – when you want the agent inside a mounted filesystem (quick grep, transforms, scaffolds) without leaving the browser.

Local CLI – when you want predictable, scriptable tasks (append session to MASTER, batch tidy, etc.).

12) Quick start checklist (for any new repo)

Create folders/files exactly as in Section 1.

Add Project Instructions from Section 4; attach the GitHub repo card; turn Memory OFF.

Add auto_commit.sh and post_chat.sh; chmod +x both.

Set PowerShell aliases for claude-export and claude-sync.

Start a new chat per component; name threads clearly.

When a chat fills up: generate Session Summary → save Markdown → claude-export.
