INSTRUCTIONS
Whenever a new chat starts:
1. If possible, read `/Claude_Prompts/start-of-chat.md`
2. Otherwise, read this file as startup context.
3. Treat it as a reasoning companion for the Carousel component family.
4. When code context is needed, refer to `/src/Components/Carousel/AdaptiveCarousel*.tsx`
5. Summarise and reason modularly, using Markdown-ready outputs.
